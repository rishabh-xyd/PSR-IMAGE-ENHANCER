# Low Light Image Enhancement for PSR Regions of Lunar Craters

## Project Overview SIH 1732

This project aims to enhance the feeble light reflected from the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR) of Lunar craters into higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) images for better interpretation and analysis.

## Challenges

- Generating better signal images from feeble signals.
- Removing noise from low light images.

## Usage

The software is designed to generate the first-of-its-kind PSR image map of the lunar poles, captured by the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) of Chandrayaan-2.

### Potential Users

- Landing site selection teams.
- Geomorphological researchers and analysts.

## Available Solutions

While general techniques and algorithms for low light image enhancement exist, a specific solution tailored for Chandrayaan-2 data needs to be developed.

## Desired Outcome

Development of software capable of enhancing low light images, specifically for the unique requirements of the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
